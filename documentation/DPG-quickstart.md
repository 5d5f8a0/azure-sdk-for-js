Getting Started - Generate the DPG libraries with TypeSpec for JavaScript
========================================================================

# Before you start

:warning: **Important**: Only proceed with DPG code generation for JavaScript/TypeScript if you have been explicitly instructed to do so by the AZSDK Architecture Board. Otherwise, please use the [RLC Quickstart Guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/rlc/js).

:warning: Ensure that your TypeSpec definition has been merged into the main branch of the [Azure REST API specs repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) before you begin.

For an overview of the review and release process for new libraries, visit: https://aka.ms/azsdk/dpcodegen.

If you have code generation queries, post them in the [TypeSpec Discussion](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a906c1efbbec54dc8949ac736633e6bdf%40thread.skype/TypeSpec%2520Discussion%2520%25F0%259F%2590%25AE?groupId=3e17dcb0-4257-4a30-b843-77f47f1d4121&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) channel.

# Setting up your development environment

Follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#prerequisites) for environment prerequisites in the Azure SDK for JS repository.

# Identifying your project's service and package name

The `service name` is a concise identifier for the Azure service and should be consistent across all SDK languages. It's typically the name of the directory in the azure-rest-api-specs repository containing your service's REST API definition.

The `package name` is used when publishing to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/). It usually follows the format `@azure/{service-name}` or `@azure/{service-name}-{module}` for services with multiple modules.

# Structuring your project

1. SDK Repo Root. 
    
    The generated libraries should be in the [azure-sdk-for-js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js) repo, so fork and clone it in your local then the absolute path is called **${SDK_REPO_ROOT} folder**.

1. Project Folder Structure.  
   The typical structure is `sdk/{servicename}/{servicename}-{modulename}`, e.g., `sdk/storage/storage-blob`. That folder is under {SDK_REPO_ROOT} and will be your **${PROJECT_ROOT} folder**. 

1. Package Name Convention.  
   Follow the format `@azure/{service-name}-{module}`, like `@azure/storage-blob`.


# Steps to Generate DPG

1. **Configure tspconfig.yaml in spec repository**
   
   In your specs repository, update or create `tspconfig.yaml` to configure the TypeScript emitter. Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_DIRECTORY`, `YOUR_SERVICE_FOLDER` and `YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME` with your specific details.

   ```yaml
   parameters:
     "service-dir":
       default: "YOUR_SERVICE_DIRECTORY"

   emit: ["@azure-tools/typespec-ts"]

   options:
     "@azure-tools/typespec-ts":
       package-dir: "YOUR_SERVICE_FOLDER"
       isModularLibrary: true
       packageDetails:
         name: YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
         description: "SHORT_DESCRIPTION"
         version: "1.0.0-beta.1"
   ```

2. **Configure tsp-location.yaml in SDK repository**  
   
   You can update `tsp-location.yaml` under project root folder to set the typespec project. You can refer to the [tsp-location.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools/blob/main/doc/common/TypeSpec-Project-Scripts.md#tsp-locationyaml) which describes the supported properties in the file.
   
   If this is the first time to generate code you need to create the project folder.
   ```shell
   mkdir -p sdk/agrifood/agrifood-farming # create project folder
   cd sdk/agrifood/agrifood-farming # enter project folder
   ```
   Then prepare the `tsp-location.yaml` and here is an example:

   ```yaml
   directory: specification/agrifood/DataPlane
   commit: b646a42aa3b7a0ce488d05f1724827ea41d12cf1 # the commit id you'd like to refer for generation
   repo: Azure/azure-rest-api-specs
   ```

3. **Generate code**

    Run the following two scripts from project directory (i.e sdk/agrifood/agrifood-farming) to generate the code:

    > NOTE: These scripts require PowerShell version 7 or higher
    ```shell
    pwsh ../../../eng/common/scripts/TypeSpec-Project-Sync.ps1 .
    ```

    followed by

    ```shell
    pwsh ../../../eng/common/scripts/TypeSpec-Project-Generate.ps1 .
    ```

    The version of typespec-ts is configured in [emitter-package.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/eng/emitter-package.json) and relevant lock file [emitter-package-lock.json](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/eng/emitter-package-lock.json). Change them in local, if you would like to use a different version of typespec-ts.

4. **Edit rush.json**  
    
    As the libraries in azure-sdk-for-js repository are managed by rush, you need to add an entry in rush.json under projects section for the first time to make sure it works. For example:

    ```
        {
          "packageName": "@azure/agrifood-farming",
          "projectFolder": "sdk/agrifood/agrifood-farming",
          "versionPolicyName": "client"
        },
    ```

    Here you also need to replace the `packageName`, `projectFolder` into your own services'.

5. **Build your project**  

    After this finishes, you will see the generated code in `src` folder in your **{PROJECT_ROOT}**.  
    To get a workable package, you can run the following commands to get a artifact if you like.

    ```shell
    rush update
    rush build -t <your-package-name> # e.g rush build -t @azure/agrifood-farming
    cd <your-sdk-folder>
    rushx pack
    ```

    The generated code is not good enough to release yet and you need to update it for better usage experience.

# Improve README.md document

A minimal README.md is generated by TypeScript emitter and you could improve README.md file per your service. To learn more about README, see an [example README.md here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/openai/openai/README.md).

# How to write test for DPG

In order to release it, we need to add some tests for it to make sure we are delivering high quality packages. After generation you will see a `sampleTest.spec.ts` file in your `{PROJECT_ROOT}/test/public` folder, which has an empty test and you could add/update test cases against your own services.

See the [Javascript Codegen Quick Start for Test](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/Quickstart-on-how-to-write-tests.md) for information on how to write and run tests for the Javascript SDK.

1. **Write the test**
    
    You could follow the [basic RLC test interaction and recording example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/Quickstart-on-how-to-write-tests.md#example-1-basic-rlc-test-interaction-and-recording-for-azure-data-plane-service) to write your test step by step. Also you could refer [the test of OpenAIClient](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/test/public) for more cases.

2. **Run the test**  
    Now, you can run the test like this. If you are the first time to run test, you need to set the environment variable `TEST_MODE` to `record`. This will generate recordings for your test they could be used in `playback` mode.
    On Linux, you could use `export` to set env variable:
    ```shell
    rush build -t ${PACKAGE_NAME}
    export TEST_MODE=record && rushx test # this will run live test and generate a recordings folder, you will need to submit it in the PR.
    ```
    On Windows, you could use `SET`:
    ```shell
    rush build -t ${PACKAGE_NAME}
    SET TEST_MODE=record&& rushx test # this will run live test and generate a recordings folder, you will need to submit it in the PR.
    ```
    You can also run the `playback` mode test if your apis don't have breaking changes and you've already done the recording before.
    On Linux, you could use below commands:
    ```shell
    rush build -t ${PACKAGE_NAME}
    export TEST_MODE=playback && rushx test # this will run live test and generate a recordings folder, you will need to submit it in the PR.
    ```
    On Windows, you can use:
    ```shell
    rush build -t ${PACKAGE_NAME}
    SET TEST_MODE=playback&& rushx test # this will run live test and generate a recordings folder, you will need to submit it in the PR.
    ```

# How to write samples

We highly encourage you to write some valid samples for your customer to get start your service with DPG. You may author TypeScript samples under the `samples-dev` folder. For quick start you can use [sample-dev template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/template/template/samples-dev) as reference and update the relevant information for your service such as package-name, sample code, description, etc. To learn more you could refer [the samples of OpenAIClient here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai/samples-dev).
After the samples-dev folder change is finished, you will need to change the tsconfig.json to make sure the dev samples can be compiled and build correctly.  

You will need to add this part to the "compilerOptions" of your tsconfig.json file so that the Samples engine could resolve the sample-dev package against the source code of the SDK.  
``` json
    "paths": { "@azure/agrifood-farming": ["./src/index"] } 
```
And change the *"include"* part into 
```json
  "include": ["./src/**/*.ts", "./test/**/*.ts", "samples-dev/**/*.ts"],
```

Then, we provide tools to automatically change it into workable samples in both TypeScript and JavaScript. and you just need to add a sampleConfiguration in your package.json.  

You will need to add a sample configuration section in your package.json file and put the following content into it.
```json
  "//sampleConfiguration": {
    "productName": "A description of your services",
    "productSlugs": ["azure"],
    "disableDocsMs": true,
    "apiRefLink": "<the-link-to-your-service-on-docs.microsoft.com>"
  }
```

Now, you can generate both JavaScript and TypeScript workable samples with the following commands.
```shell
npm install -g common/tools/dev-tool # make sure you are in the azure-sdk-for-js repo root directory
cd ${PROJECT_ROOT}
npx dev-tool samples publish -f 
```
You will see the workable samples in the `${PROJECT_ROOT}/samples` folder.  

# Format both the generated code and manual code
After you have finished the generation and added your own tests or samples, You can use the following command to format the code.  
```shell
cd ${PROJECT_ROOT} && rushx format
```
 
Also we'll recommand you to run `lint` command to analyze your code and quickly find any problems.

```shell
cd ${PROJECT_ROOT} && rushx lint
```

And we could use `lint:fix` if there are any errors.

```shell
cd ${PROJECT_ROOT} && rushx lint:fix
```

# How to create package

Now we can use the exact same steps to build a releasable artifact.

```shell
rush update
rush build -t <your-package-name>
cd <your-sdk-folder>
export TEST_MODE=record && rushx test
rushx pack
```
You may send this artifact to your customer if your services are still in private preview and some customers want to try it out.
# Create/Update the ci.yaml

Now, if everything looks good to you, you can submit a PR in azure-sdk-for-js repo with all the changes you made above. Before you do that, you need to add/update the ci.yml file. Depends on whether there's already one in your package folder.

If there's no such file then you can add the following template.

``` yaml
# NOTE: Please refer to https://aka.ms/azsdk/engsys/ci-yaml before editing this file.
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - release/*
      - hotfix/*
  paths:
    include:
      - sdk/purview/
pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - feature/*
      - release/*
      - hotfix/*
    exclude:
      - feature/v4
  paths:
    include:
      - sdk/purview/
extends:
  template: ../../eng/pipelines/templates/stages/archetype-sdk-client.yml
  parameters:
    ServiceDirectory: purview
    Artifacts:
      - name: azure-agrifood-farming
        safeName: azureagrifoodfarming
```

Please change the paths.include value as your own project path, and change the Artifacts name and safeName into yours.  

If there's already a ci.yml file in your project path. then the only thing you need to do is to add the Artifacts name and safeName of yours into that ci.yml.  

Please notice the Artifacts name should align with your package name. Here the package name is `@azure/agrifood-farming` so the relevant Artifacts name is `azure-agrifood-farming`.


# Prepare PR

TypeScript emitter can only help you generate SDK code, there is something you need to update manually:

## CHANGELOG.md

CHANGELOG can help customers know the change of new version quickly, so you need to update the it according to the change of this new version. It is also necessary to update release date like `1.0.0-beta.1 (2022-11-11)`(rough time is fine and no need to be very accurate).

## Version Number

You shall update the version number according to [semantic versioning rule](https://semver.org/).

## Test recordings

Please ensure that your test recordings are committed together with your code.

## Fix CI for PR
You may meet the CI failures after submitting the PR, so please refer to [Troubleshoot CI Failure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/documentation/Troubleshoot-ci-failure.md) to fix it.

## CC dpg-devs for review

Please add below comment in your pr to include dpg-devs to review your pr timely.

```
cc @Azure/dpg-devs for awareness
```

# Create API View
When submitting a PR our pipeline would automatically prepare the API view in [API View Website](https://apiview.dev/). You could see an [example link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/23866#issuecomment-1316259448) here. Then you could click the API view link in that comment to know more details.
# Release

After the PR is merged, it is time to release package. Here is the [Release Checklist](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_wiki/wikis/internal.wiki/8/Release-Checklist?anchor=prepare-release-script) you should know before release.
